<h1>Premier League Memory Game</h1>

<h2> WHAT IS IT? </h2>

<p> This is a premier League Memory game it has been designed to be suitable and enjoyable for all ages. 
    The game lets people find a match of two cards of the same image. 
    If all matches are found before the countdown timer </p>

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>As stated above the game has been designed for all ages, so the apperance has been made as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The game allows football fans to find their favourite premier league team badges. Once the game is loaded there is a </p>
<p>homepage that welcomes you to the game, there are also two buttons on the page one to play the game and another to tell the </p>
<p>player how to play the game. When the how to play button is clicked a modal will activate with instructions on how to play</p> 
<p>the game. When the play button is clicked a modal will activate with two buttons for two levels of diffculty, either a</p> 
<p>3 X 4 or a 4 X 5 grid difficulty.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>How-to-Play - Showing a popup with instructions on how to play the game</p>

<p>Timer - Shows the user how many moves have been made within the time limit, including a "try-again" to reload the game and start again.</p>

<p>Success - An alert will popup if all tiles have been matched within the time limit.</p>

<p>Failure - An alert will popup if some tiles havent been matched within the time limit with the players score</p>

<p>Stage levels - The game includes different levels that will include more tiles with every stage</p>

<p>Mute sound - This button mutes the sound which can be unmuted aswell.</p>

<h2> Future features </h2>
<p>Adding more stages</p>

<h2>Tools/Technologies</h2>
<h2>AWS Cloud9</h2>
<p>Cloud9 hosted my Workspace for this project</p>

<h2>Git</h2>
<p>Used to push and commit any and all changes to my repository on GitHub</p>

<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
<p>Allows for extra responsiveness of html5 and JavaScript files, also Provided my buttons and modal.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS3 has been implemented for styling the game.<p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript has been used to implement the functionalities of the tile creation, shuffling the tiles and showing the correct alert popups when the count-down timer has ended.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>The HTML and CSS coding was tested by using the W3C Mark Validator Service by direct input.</p>
<p>To test the responsiveness of the website in phones, tablets, and desktops screens, I have used the Chrome Developer Tools, verifying how the site reacts in different screen sizes.</p>
<p>The JavaScript files were tested using https://jslint.com/ by direct input of the files on the validator.</p>
<p>The game functionality, tested on multiple browers such as Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox.</p>
<p>The game has been tested by some of my friends with the question if the game was clear, easy to use and understandable.</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>Had some issues with the re-sizing of the tiles on smaller devices. Since these kind of games are not made for small mobile devices, I kept iPad size in mind as the smallest easy accesible play-size</p>
<p>The syntax order of the script.js file was re-adjusted in accordance to the jslint validator. If a match was made the matched cards were still able to get clicked. This has been resolved by turning off the connected CSS animation class.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>The project was developed using the AWS IDE. New features or changes made to the code, were added and committed to the local repository.</p>
<p>The local commits were later pushed to my GitHub repository. The project was deployed using GitHub.</p>

<p>Step 1: Go to the settings tab of the repo, scrolled down to GitHub Pages</p>

<p>Step 2: Under GitHub Pages -> Source is a scrolldown box titled None. Click it and you can select a source.</p>
